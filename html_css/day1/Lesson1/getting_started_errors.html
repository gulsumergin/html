            The W3C validator reluctantly accepts the document as valid with just a few warnings 
            when it is pasted into the direct input form, 
            but when the document is uploaded or loaded by URI, validation fails with this error message
        if you are using the File Upload option, it depends on which encoding the HTML file was saved with.
        if you are using the Direct Input option, it depends on the navigator.
        If you don't want the validator to guess, and use UTF-8, you can add the following line

        <meta charset="UTF-8"> inside the the head element. -->
